# King's Return | Modpack | 1.16.5
A public modpack running on 1.16.5 consisting of vanilla+ mods mostly. Beware, it's hard pack! Requires about 6 GB RAM to run smooth, and shaders are included. You can disable them.

# How to install?
> You need to import this into your ATLauncher instance. Other launchers may or not be supported, tested only on AT.

# What can you expect?
- You can expect a lot of surprising moments to your game. Mostly, it's hard difficulty pack, made more for veterans, but is also suitable for people who want to get into modded universe.
- There are a lot of new creatures, and new ways to build your machines and farms. You will be able to get items in every way imaginable, be it from trading with villagers, piglin bartering, looting, fishing, or claiming bounties.
- It has built-in protection system for multiplayer. This means, it uses FTP Chunks, which also serves as server map, and minimap too.
- Shaders are enabled by default, as well as default optimized configuration. Graphics enhancements are on edge here, and I think you will find them pleasurable.
- Undead mobs will certainly make your life harder. There are a lot of new undead variants and mobs, some of which are flying-type.
- Did you ever want to mount a dragon? Well you can, Dragon Mounts: Legacy mod is included!
- Explore new wonderful structures, beautiful caves and underground, treasures in water, and even ocean-related content!
- When I said it's hard, it takes average of 100 minecraft days to get into the End dimension, since you need to collect 12 eyes from various structures to activate portal. That is End Remastered!
- While in end, you will find tons of new biomes, and creatures and even bosses!
- Minimal lags, I hope. I optimize packs as best as I can. This is to be tested, but it goes well so far! Just keep in mind to have not render distance over 12.
- Cute little animals, mobs, and ambience you will not forget! The feel of the game is amazing.
- a brand new Afterlight dimension! Strange new things await you there.
- Waystones are also very useful. Make home anywhere, make mine anywhere, or be a nomad with this gorgeous mod!
- A lot of ambience, and cool effects.

# Other features?
- Yes! Modpack has Essential Mod! This means, you can connect with friends at any time, play with them without server, and chat in real time! It also supports group chats, and allows to send screenshots.
- New music! A lot of new music will be played, alongside the old nether tracks!
- A lot of tweaks to client, including the not-so-client Quark, and many other mods such as Tool Swap!
- Cosmetic armor is a thing here too!
- A lot, a lot, and a lot of furniture and amazing pieces to decorate your world.
